 <p class="intro">Bowser was created with the sole purpose to make school life a little easier for everybody. We know that Covid-19 has made school even more difficult for some people, but that is what Bowser is here for. Our Student to Student help function is perfect for online students that do not have immediate access to teachers. Bowser can also translate text for students that are not strong in English. Additionally, there is a text to speech function to help them speak to other students more fluidly. If you are worried about Covid-19, Bowser can give you all the Covid-19 statistics for any country you choose.
